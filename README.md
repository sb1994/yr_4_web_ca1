# React App that connects to the Marvel API
This project was created as part of the first CA to implement a react app that uses a third party API

The reason for using the Marvel Api was because I'm a big fan of the marvel universe and have always wanted to create an app using the api



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
